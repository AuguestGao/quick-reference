  Check conda guide for virtual environment installation and usage

1. install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads)
2. Activate env
3. in **anaconda prompt**, install jupyter notebook `conda install jupyter`

## Launch

1. cd to desired folder (having the notebook or where you want ot create one)
2. `jupyter notebook` to start the server (leave the prompt running)

_note: for start a new notebook in a newly created env, see below section._

## Use Jupyter Notebook in an virtual env

Before you are about to launch a notebook in your newly created env, you must create a new jupyter kernel for it to work.

### Why do I need this kernel thing?

Basically, jupyter needs its kernel (IPython) to run!

See Jupyter official explaination about the kernel below.

> Kernels are programming language specific processes that run independently and interact with the Jupyter Applications and their user interfaces. **IPython** is the reference Jupyter kernel, providing a powerful environment for interactive computing in Python. -- Jupyter Website

### Create a new kernel

1. (maybe) Install IPython: Ipython should be installed automatically along with the installtion of jupyter. However, if you need to install it manually:
   `pip install ipython`

2. Install a new kernel using new environment
   `ipython kernel install -user -name=name_of_kernel`

   - list all kernels: `jupyter kernelspec list`
   - uninstall a kernel: `jupyter kernelspec uninstall name_of_kernel`

3. Launch the notebook `jupyter notebook` and choose `new > name_of_kernel` for a fresh notebook

## Format

### Enable line wrap

Found it is annoying for scolling left and right for the line of code with 1000 chars? You can enable auto wrap in 30 secs as below.

1. Locate .jupyter directory, don't where it is? `jupyter --config-dir` to check
2. open .jupyter/nbconfig/notebook.json add `"lineWrapping": true`, save and done!

Below is my config, I specified using lineNumbers and lineWrapping only in code cells but keep markdown cells untouched.

```json
{
  "MarkdownCell": {
    "cm_config": {
      "lineNumbers": false
    }
  },
  "CodeCell": {
    "cm_config": {
      "lineNumbers": true,
      "lineWrapping": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Use Code Formatter

You can use code formatter to format your code, which it is a better option in my opinion. I use black, but there are also yapf available.

1. install nb_black
   - if conda-forge in the conda channel: `conda install nb_black`
   - if conda-forge not in the channel: `conda install -c conda-forge black`
2. in jupyter notebook, add `%load_ext nb_black` on the very top as a code cell and run it once.
3. to use, re-execute the cell you want to format.
