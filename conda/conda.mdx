# Conda Guide

## Anacodna and Miniconda

Anaconda has GUI and install many popular packages along with the installation of Anaconda. Miniconda is the light version of Anaconda which does not have a GUI and has barely no pre-install packages. This guide is focus on miniconda using the conda prompt.

## Create an virtual environment

### Default env path

```bash
conda create --name env_name python=3.8
conda activate env_name
conda deactivate
conda remove --name env_name --all
```

### Specify env path

```bash
conda create --prefix /path/to/folder/env_name python=3.7
conda activate /path/to/folder/env_name
codna deactivate
conda remove --prefix /path/to/folder/env_name --all
```

## Packages and channels

Channels are like source where conda can fetch packages from. By default, conda will fetch from default channel, [see all packages included in the default channel](https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/).

1. Create and activate a virtual env first before installing any packages
2. Install a package using below method according to the situation

### packages in the default channel

simply install via `conda install package_name`
If installation fails due to the package cannot be found. There is a chance that the package is not included in the default channel (see below).

### Install package from a specified channels

One time use, this channel won't be added in the channel list, need to run the same code next time

`conda install -c channel_name package_name`

for exmaple, `conda install -c conda-forge fnn`

### Add channel into conda channel list

Add channel to the conda channel list.

```
conda config -add channels channel_name
conda install package_name
```

For future, only run `conda install package_name`

Using conda-forge as an example.

[Conda forge](https://conda-forge.org/) is a community led conda packages repo where can be added as a channel.

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda install <package-name>
```

## Other Common conda command

- check all env names: `conda env list`
- check conda package channels: `conda config --show channels`
- update a package: `conda update package_name`
  note: see conda cheatsheet for more commands.
